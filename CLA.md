#Taryn Hill's Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to open source software projects ("Projects") made available by Taryn Hill. This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") sets out the terms governing any source code, object code, bug fixes, configuration changes, tools, specifications, documentation, data, materials, feedback, information or other works of authorship that you submit or have submitted, in any form and in any manner, to Taryn Hill in respect of any of the Projects (collectively "Contributions"). If you have any questions respecting this Agreement, please contact `contributions@phrohdoh.com`. You agree that the following terms apply to all of your past, present and future Contributions. Except for the licenses granted in this Agreement, you retain all of your right, title and interest in and to your Contributions.

**Why is a CLA necessary?**

It depends on the jurisdiction but in many countries contributions are owned by the author or their employer. When the contribution is accepted, the project becomes a bundle of derivative works. The agreement of all contributors are necessary to maintain distribution of the complete project and to any licensing agreement.

**Isn't that the purpose of an open source license?**

Most open source licenses deal with use of the original code, and don't refer to contributions, or derivatives of the original.

**How does a CLA protect a project?**

If the owner of a contribution decides that they don't want the contribution to be part of the project or in any given distribution, the law is on their side. The project, contributors, and users may be subject to legal action. This may require payment of damages and could prevent further usage or contributions until the matter is resolved.

Even when there is no legal pursuit, too much ambiguity can jeopardize or doom a project by preventing those that can't risk legal action from getting involved.

You hereby grant, and agree to grant, to Taryn Hill a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully-paid, royalty-free, transferable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contributions alone or by combination of your Contributions with the Project to which such Contributions were submitted, with the right to sublicense the foregoing rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees.

##Rights
